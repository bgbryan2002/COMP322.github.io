    As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <u>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u>
    <mark>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</mark>In the moonlight I looked at
    his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
    <span style="color: firebrick;">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
    

    <span style="color: firebrick;">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a
    rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."
    </span>And I felt him to be more fragile still.
    <u>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of
      wind...</u>
